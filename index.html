							'interactions between immune cells and endometrial cells in the peritoneal fluid. We develop a novel compartmental model ' +
							'that captures the dynamics between innate immune cells — specifically macrophages and natural killer cells — and ectopic ' +

							'detection, and immune clearance. We find that although increased retrograde menstration leads to heightened pro-inflammatory '+
							'macrophage activation, this alone does not trigger disease. Instead, our results suggest that reduced immune cytotoxicity ' +
							'plays a central role in driving disease onset. We also observe that once the system shifts into a diseased state, due to ' +

						'Many systems in biology, chemistry, epidemiology and ecology involve both stochastic and deterministic behaviours, ' +
						'but capturing both in a single model can be difficult. For example, traditional models, like the Lotka-Volterra ' +
						'equations, can predict tiny, unrealistic population levels — so-called atto-foxes — when dealing with very small populations. ' +
						'This becomes a major issue when studying things like species extinction or the clearance of an infection, where stochasticity ' +
						'plays a key role. While discrete stochastic models like continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) can handle this properly, ' +
						'they are often too slow to simulate for large systems. To solve this, we have developed a new framework called ' +
						'Jump-Switch-Flow (JSF), which combines the accuracy of CTMCs with the speed of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ' +
						'JSF allows populations to truly reach extinction, avoiding the atto-fox issue. We apply our framework to several case ' +
						'studies, including public health intervention analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection data. We have also make JSF Openly Available as an easy-to-use Python package. ' +
						'Overall, JSF is a powerful new tool for modelling complex, multi-scale systems more realistically and efficiently.',

							'We develop a mathematical model to study how tissues deform under mechanical stress, focusing on how individual cells respond through elastic '+
							'and plastic deformation. Cells in tissue are connected via adhesion molecules and can actively remodel when stretched. Our model captures this ' +
							'by allowing cells to shift between two stable sizes, depending on the level of stress—reflecting experimentally observed behaviour. Without '+ 
							'remodelling, the model simplifies to a standard linear interaction model. Under instantaneous remodelling, we perform a bifurcation analysis ' +
							'to identify when bistable cell sizes arise. Under more general remodelling, simulations show tissues can contain both original and elongated cells ' +
							'after sufficient stress. This work offers new insight into how tissues reshape through stress-driven cell-level mechanics.',

							'cell migration and cell death must be finely balanced. While tissues like the endothelium, mesothelium, and linings of organs such as the lungs and gut ' +
							'are common, few models capture how these structures stay stable over time. In this work, we develop a novel 3D, deformable, multilayer cell-centre model ' +
